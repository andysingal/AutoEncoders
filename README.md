# AutoEncoders

Topics:
- What are autoencoders?:  Autoencoders are neural networks that have the ability to discover low-dimensional representations of high-dimensional data and are able to reconstruct the input from the output. Autoencoders are made up of two pieces of the neural network, an encoder and a decoder. The encoder reduces the dimensionality of a high dimensional dataset to a low dimensional one whereas a decoder essentially expands the low-dimensional data to high-dimensional data. The goal of such a process is to try to reconstruct the original input. If the neural network is good, then there is a good chance of reconstructing the original input from the encoded data.
